# A-Collection-of-Neural-Dynamics-Learnings
This repository contains a collection of resources and papers on *PDE Solving*, *Operator Learning* and *PDE Identification*. They are archived based on my understanding.

### How backbone model structures in industry are utilized in the PDE scenarios?
The commonly used model structures used includes:
1. Deep convolutional network for feature extraction.
2. Unet for autoencoder.
3. Transformer for sequence to sequence prediction.
4. LSTR for sequence to sequence prediction.
