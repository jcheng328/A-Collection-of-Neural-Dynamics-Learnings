This repository contains a collection of resources and papers on *PDE Solving*, *Operator Learning* and *PDE Identification*. They are archived based on my understanding. 

### Loss: Regression or Classification?
The commonly used loss 
- Regression
- 1. MSE loss
 
- Classification
- 1. Cross Entropy
 
There're three type of predictions,
- 1. noise prediction
  2. target prediction
  3. vector prediction

The penalty are then usually posed on
1. vectors
2. gradients of model
 

### How backbone model structures in industry are utilized in the PDE scenarios?
The commonly used model structures used includes:
1. Multilayer Perceptron
2. Deep convolutional network for feature extraction.
3. Deep networks e.g., ResNet
4. Unet for autoencoder.
5. Transformer for sequence to sequence prediction.
6. LSTR for sequence to sequence prediction.

### Conditions
There're three types of conditions:
1. time embedding
2. text embedding
3. condition 

### Dig deeper in neural networks and math
1. How transformer is related to the integration? 

### How adversarial learning is important?
